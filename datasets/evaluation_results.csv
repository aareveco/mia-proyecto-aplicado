The poor lipophilic properties of\nACN have led to the conviction that they are underabsorbed.\nHorwitt (11) was perhaps the ﬁrst to observe the ACN pig-\nments in the urine of rabbits. Recently, however, several\ninvestigators have concluded that ACN can be absorbed in\nboth human and animal bodies as intact forms (12 –23). Some\ninvestigators have shown that quercetin glucosides may inter-\nact with the intestinal glucose transporter and be absorbed in\nthat manner (28 –30). Whether ACN could be absorbed by a\nsimilar mechanism remains unknown. Mu ¨ lleder et al. (22)\ncompared the urinary excretion when elderberry ACN were\nconsumed with and without simultaneous ingestion of sugar.\nThe total excretion of ACN with sugar was lower than that\nwithout sugar, indicating that sugar carriers might play a role\nin ﬂavonoid absorption. The presence of the sambubioside\nform gives strong credence to this as it is unlikely that the\nsambubioside form could be reformed from the aglycone after\nits absorption.\nPrevious studies have also indicated that methylation is an\nestablished pathway in the metabolism of ﬂavonoids (26). For\nseveral ﬂavonoids with 3 /H11032,4 /H11032-dihydroxylation of ring B, con-\njugates of their 3 /H11032-O-methyl ethers were excreted (31 –32).\nThis transformation occurred in the liver and was catalyzed by\ncatechol-O-methyl transferase (14,33). Cyanidin is an antho-\ncyanidin with a 3 /H11032,4 /H11032-dihydroxylation pattern of ring B. We\ndetected peonidin 3-glucoside and peonidin 3-sambubioside in\nthe urine from humans. Miyazawa et al. (15) found a methyl-\nated form of an ACN in liver of rats and the concentration of\nthe methylated form was much higher than the original form\nin the liver, but they did not detect it in plasma and urine.\nThey (15) assumed that these methylated compounds were\nexcreted from the liver into bile directly. However, we de-\ntected the methylated form of ACN in the urine of humans.\nThus, they must appear in the blood and be excreted by the\nkidney.\nConjugations with glucuronic acid or with sulfate are con-\nsidered the major detoxication pathways of many drugs and\nxenobiotic compounds. They are also the common ﬁnal steps\nin the metabolic pathway of ﬂavonoids in mammalian systems\n(26,34). These modiﬁcations could start in the small intestine,\nliver, or kidney (35 –36). UDP-glucuronosyl transferase and\nsulfotransferase in the liver would likely be responsible for this\nconjugation (26,37). So far, many different subclasses of ﬂa-\nvonoids have been found to be absorbed and excreted as\nglucuronide forms in both humans and experimental animals\n(26,35,37,38). But for ACN, no glucuronide or sulfate conju-\ngated forms have been found in urine or plasma of either\nhumans or experimental animals. This observation is com-\npletely different from other ﬂavonoids, such as catechin and\nepicatechin, or iso ﬂavones such as genistein and daidzein,\nwhose basic structures are similar to ACN. Miyazawa et al.\n(15) assumed that the ﬂavylium cation structure of ACN may\nimpart resistance to such enzymatic conversion into conju-\ngates.\nIn our studies we detected the glucuronide conjugate forms\nfor the ﬁrst time. These results indicate that ACN might share\nsome of the same metabolic pathways with other ﬂavonoid\ncompounds. Perhaps, others did not detect them because of\nthe low concentrations of these metabolites. We detected and\ntentatively identi ﬁed them using diode –array detector and\nMS. We were unsuccessful in hydrolyzing the conjugate with\nthe enzyme\n/H9252-glucuronidase (1 U/L for 30 min). Hydrolysis of\nthe conjugated forms of ACN presents particular challenges in\nthat ACN are unstable at neutral pH. The ACN disappeared\ncompletely when we incubated the plasma samples for 3 h.', 'the conjugated forms of ACN presents particular challenges in\nthat ACN are unstable at neutral pH.

Two possible pathways could de-\nscribe the formation of this metabolite ( Fig. 6). Cyanidin-3-\nglucoside could be absorbed intact and some methylated to\nform peonidin-3-glucoside in the liver (Fig. 6; Pathway 1).\nEither cyanidin-3-glucoside or peonidin-3-glucoside could\nserve as a substrate for UDP-glucose dehydrogenase to form\nthe corresponding glucuronide from the glucose form. For this\nto occur, cyanidin-3-glucoside or peonidin-3-glucoside would\nhave to serve as a substrate for the enzyme UDP-glucose\ndehydrogenase, which converts UDP-glucose into UDP-gluc-\nuronic acid. UDP-glucose dehydrogenase (GDH) is a unique\nenzyme pathway which furnishes in vertebrates the UDP-\nglucuronic acid for numerous transferases, including those of\nglycosaminoglycan synthesis and xenobiotics elimination\n(39). GDH is present in both the liver and the small intestine\nof the rats, guinea pigs, and mice (40,41). This hypothesis\nwould explain the presence of peonidin-glucuronide. This\npathway seems likely since we have found all of these com-\npounds in urine.\nA second possibility (Fig. 6, Pathway 2) is that cyanidin-\n3-glucoside is hydrolyzed to the aglycone in the intestine and\nabsorbed. In the liver, the cyanidin could be methylated and\nconjugated to form peonidin monoglucuronide. However, cy-\nanidin is unstable in plasma and may form protocatechuic acid\n(14). No cyanidin aglycone has been detected in the plasma of\nhumans (15) or rats (14), but it has been demonstrated in rat\njejunum (14). If these reactions occurred, we would expect to\nﬁnd peonidin aglycone and cyanidin glucuronide, which we\nhave not detected. However, a challenge in all of this work is\nthat we are generally working near the limits of detection of\nFIGURE 6 Glucuronide conjugated forms from cyanidin-3-glu-\ncoside.

The ACN disappeared\ncompletely when we incubated the plasma samples for 3 h.', 'many of these compounds with current instrumentation and\nmethods, and the concentrations of some of these intermedi-\nates may be so low that they are undetectable.\nWe found a glucuronide of cyanidin-3-glucoside in the\nurine of 2 of the 4 women who consumed elderberry (Table 1).\nCyanidin has four free hydroxyl groups. According to Boutin\net al. (37), different hydroxyl positions on the ﬂavonoid dios-\nmetin have different capacities for glucuronidation. Based on\nthese results, we would expect that each hydroxyl group on\ncyanidin, likewise, would have a different glucuronidation\ncapacity. Based on the work by Boutin et al. (37), for 5,\n7-dihydroxy compounds, the main site for glucuronidation\nseems to be the 7-position; for the trihydroxy compound, the\nmain conjugation site was the 3 /H11032-position. We speculate that\nglucuronidation of cyanidin-3-glucoside may occur most\nreadily at the 3 /H11032-position, but this needs to be veri ﬁed. Even\nthough there are differences in the activities of the different\nhydroxyl groups, we might expect to see more than the one\nmajor glucuronide conjugate form. Again, it may be that\nconcentrations are so low that we are unable to detect them.\nAlthough we used nearly the same amount of total ACN\nfrom blueberry as from elderberry, the amount of ACN in the\nurine samples from the women who consumed the blueberry\nwas much lower. That may be for two reasons. First, the\ncontent of any individual ACN in blueberry is lower by a\nfactor of ﬁve- to 10-fold compared with that in elderberry, thus\nmaking detection of any single ACN much more dif ﬁcult.\nThere are /H1102225 individual ACN in blueberry and no single\nACN is dominant. However, in elderberry, two ACN account\nfor /H1102290% of the total ACN. The second reason for the lower\nabsorption from blueberry may lie in the form in which the\nACN were given. In the elderberry study, the ACN were in an\nextract and thus in a concentrated form. In the blueberry\nstudy, the ACN were given as part of the whole berry. Ab-\nsorption from a plant extract will likely be much better than\nfrom the raw plant where the ACN have not been extracted\nfrom the plant cell. When we compared the urinary excretion\nof the individual ACN to the relative amounts of ACN in the\nblueberry meal (Fig. 5), the proportion of most ACN excreted\nin urine was consistent with that in the meal. The exceptions\nwere with the arabinosides of delphinidin, petunidin, and\nmalvidin. This may indicate that the arabinoside forms may be\nabsorbed or metabolized in a different manner.\nIn Table 2, we compared the concentrations of ACN in\nplasma and the total urinary ACN excretion from different\npapers that we are aware of that report this information in\nhumans. It is clear from all but one of these studies that the\nrecovery of ACN or ACN metabolites in urine is quite low\n(0.004– 0.11% of dose). The one study in which urinary ex-\ncretion was much higher (13) involved subjects who con-\nsumed wine and the “ACN-like” compounds which absorbed\nat 520 nm and were not well characterized. It may be that\nACN in wine are absorbed to a much greater extent than from\nberries or berry juices or extracts.\nIn summary, we observed for the ﬁrst time the presence of\nglucuronide forms of ACN, namely peonidin monogluc-\nuronide and cyanidin-3-glucoside monoglucuronide, in the\nurine of humans after the consumption of elderberry ACN.\nWe observed the apparent methylation of both cyanidin-3-\nglucoside and cyanidin-3-sambubioside to peonidin-3-glu-\ncoside and peonidin-3-sambubioside. We were unable to de-\ntect ACN in plasma from women who consumed a single meal\nof blueberries; however, they were detectable in the urine but\nthe quantities were quite low, with the total amount excreted\nduring the ﬁrst 6 h being only 0.004% of the quantity con-\nsumed.\nLITERATURE CITED\n1.

that ACN are unstable at neutral pH. The ACN disappeared
completely when we incubated the plasma samples for 3 h.
Because previous investigators have relied on detecting the
conjugated forms using the difference in ACN concentrations
before and after incubation with
/H9252-glucuronidase, small
amounts of degradation during the incubation might mask any
conjugates that were present.
In this study, we still do not know how the peonidin
monoglucuronide is formed. Two possible pathways could de-
scribe the formation of this metabolite ( Fig. 6). Cyanidin-3-
glucoside could be absorbed intact and some methylated to
form peonidin-3-glucoside in the liver (Fig. 6; Pathway 1).
Either cyanidin-3-glucoside or peonidin-3-glucoside could
serve as a substrate for UDP-glucose dehydrogenase to form
the corresponding glucuronide from the glucose form. For this
to occur, cyanidin-3-glucoside or peonidin-3-glucoside would
have to serve as a substrate for the enzyme UDP-glucose
dehydrogenase, which converts UDP-glucose into UDP-gluc-
uronic acid. UDP-glucose dehydrogenase (GDH) is a unique
enzyme pathway which furnishes in vertebrates the UDP-
glucuronic acid for numerous transferases, including those of
glycosaminoglycan synthesis and xenobiotics elimination
(39). GDH is present in both the liver and the small intestine
of the rats, guinea pigs, and mice (40,41). This hypothesis
would explain the presence of peonidin-glucuronide. This
pathway seems likely since we have found all of these com-
pounds in urine.
A second possibility (Fig. 6, Pathway 2) is that cyanidin-
3-glucoside is hydrolyzed to the aglycone in the intestine and
absorbed. In the liver, the cyanidin could be methylated and
conjugated to form peonidin monoglucuronide. However, cy-
anidin is unstable in plasma and may form protocatechuic acid
(14). No cyanidin aglycone has been detected in the plasma of
humans (15) or rats (14), but it has been demonstrated in rat
jejunum (14). If these reactions occurred, we would expect to
ﬁnd peonidin aglycone and cyanidin glucuronide, which we
have not detected. However, a challenge in all of this work is
that we are generally working near the limits of detection of

ANTHOCYANIN METABOLITES IN HUMANS 1869","The DISCUSSION section indicates that ACN have been considered to not be absorbed in the human body, unless they were ﬁrst hydrolyzed to the aglycone in the gastrointestinal tract, due to their poor lipophilic properties. However, recent investigations have concluded that ACN can be absorbed in both human and animal bodies as intact forms. Methylation is an established pathway in the metabolism of ﬂavonoids, and the methylated form of ACN has been detected in the urine of humans. Conjugations with glucuronic acid or with sulfate are considered the major detoxication pathways of many drugs and xenobiotic compounds and the common ﬁnal steps in the metabolic pathway of ﬂavonoids in mammalian systems. However, no glucuronide or sulfate conjugated forms have previously been found in urine or plasma of either humans or experimental animals for ACN. The DISCUSSION highlights that glucuronide conjugate forms were detected for the ﬁrst time in these studies, indicating that ACN might share some of the same metabolic pathways with other ﬂavonoid compounds. The low concentrations of these metabolites may be why others did not detect them. Attempts to hydrolyze the conjugate with the enzyme /H9252-glucuronidase (1 U/L for 30 min) were unsuccessful, possibly due to the instability of ACN at neutral pH.",0.9999999999666667,1.0

With this aim, cocoa powder sam -\nples submitted to different alkalization degrees (light, medium, and strong) were analyzed. Metabolite extraction \nwas performed using 75% MeOH in water since it provided the highest number of molecular features. After data \nprocessing, non-supervised and supervised methods were applied to carry out the statistical data analysis. Thus, \nthe most significant metabolites that allow establishing differences among the cocoa powder samples submitted \nto the alkalization processes were pointed out. Thus, 43 and 30 metabolites in positive and negative ionization \nmodes, respectively, demonstrated to be relevant. Among them, 9 compounds were unequivocally identified and \n22 tentatively identified. Most of them were amino acids, alkaloids, organic acids or polyphenols, among others.   \n1. Introduction \nCocoa is a highly valued product, consumed all over the world not \nonly for its pleasant flavor and aroma but also for the nutritional and \nhealth benefits that it presents. These properties make cocoa a suitable \ningredient in the food industry and personal care products. Despite the \nsweet flavor of chocolate (the most known cocoa-based product) cocoa \nis characterized by presenting acidity, astringency, and bitterness \nproperties. These non-desirable properties could be reduced using an \nalkalization (or dutching) process ( Sioriki et al., 2021 ; Valverde et al., \n2020 ) which is based on the combination of an alkali solution (usually \nNaOH and K\n2\nCO\n3 \nin concentration from 1 to 6%) with cocoa. A partic -\nular temperature, (from 60 to 130 \n◦\nC), and pressure (from 0.10 to 1.22 \nMPa) are applied during a period between 5 and 180 min ( Valve -\nrde-García et al., 2020 ). In general, the final product is classified ac -\ncording to its pH value, which may range from pH 5.0 to pH 8.0. In this \nway, the product is labeled as dark natural if the pH is between 5.0 and \n6.0, light alkalized cocoa when the pH is from 6.0 to 7.2, medium \nalkalized cocoa when the pH range is between 7.2 and 7.6, and strongly \nalkalized cocoa when the product has a pH value higher than 7.6 ( Miller \net al., 2008 ). The use of the different alkalized cocoa powders depends \non the final application of the product: natural and light alkalized cocoa \npowders are employed to produce chocolate, ice creams, and cocoa \nbeverages whereas medium and strong alkalized cocoa powders are \nmainly used to prepare ice creams and bakery products such as cookies \nor cakes ( Valverde-García et al., 2020 ). \nDepending on the alkali solution, temperature, pressure, and time', 'mainly used to prepare ice creams and bakery products such as cookies \nor cakes ( Valverde-García et al., 2020 ). \nDepending on the alkali solution, temperature, pressure, and time \nemployed, cocoa solubility, color, and flavor might change. Color \nchanges may be due to Maillard reactions, polyphenol polymerization \nand oxidation, or the increased activity of polyphenol oxidase enzyme at \nhigher pHs ( Valverde-García et al., 2020 ). \nCocoa is composed of a great variety of compounds such as carbo -\nhydrates, proteins, fats, polyphenols, methylxanthines, minerals, vita -\nmins, and amino acids ( Martín & Ramos, 2017 ). Certainly, the \nalkalization process implies several chemical transformations which can \nmodify the cocoa composition but also its nutritional, sensory, and \nmicrobiological characteristics. Several works have investigated the \nchange in the composition of alkalized cocoa ( Valverde-García et al., \n* Corresponding author. Universidad de Alcal ´a.

Moreover, molecular fea -\ntures present in 100% of the QC samples with a coefficient of variation \nbelow 30% were selected for statistical analysis. Multivariate statistical \nanalysis was performed with SIMCA 14.0 software (Umetrics, Umeå, \nSweden). Data was centered and divided by the square root of the \nstandard deviation as a scaling factor (Pareto scaling). Both, unsuper -\nvised principal component analysis (PCA), to evaluate clustering in the \nanalyzed samples, and partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS- \nDA), to discriminate samples according to their alkalization degree, \nwere carried out. Models were evaluated by the good-ness-of-fit pa -\nrameters R\n2\nX, R\n2\nY, and Q\n2\n. \n2.7. Metabolite identification \nIdentification was based on the molecular features which presented \nsignificant differences in the PLS-DA model. This process was performed \nusing the CEU Mass Mediator ( Gil de la Fuente et al., 2018 ), and FooDB \ndatabase ( http://foodb.ca ) considering an error of 30 ppm. Metabolites \nshowing significant differences among groups and those commercially \navailable were purchased and analyzed under the same experimental \nconditions. The comparison of retention times and MS/MS fragmenta -\ntion was carried out to confirm the metabolite identification. When \nstandards were not commercially available, experimental MS/MS \nspectra were compared to those described in the HMDB database, \nliterature, and predicted spectra in CFM-ID ( https://cfmid.wishartlab. \ncom/ ). \n3. Results and discussion \n3.1. Optimization of the extraction procedure \nOne of the most crucial steps in an untargeted metabolomic analysis \nis sample preparation since it will directly influence the results obtained. \nIdeally, the sample preparation should be as non-selective as possible to \nensure a broad coverage of the metabolome. \nThe approach followed for optimizing the extraction procedure was \nbased on the achievement of the greatest number of molecular features \nfrom cocoa samples. Previous results obtained by our research group \nrelated to the use of an HPLC-MS-based metabolomics approach to \nreveal cocoa powder adulterations demonstrated that a defatting step \n(to remove fatty acid content), the use of a thermomixer (as it enabled \nthe control of temperature), and 30 min of extraction time were the most \nappropriate conditions to carry out the extraction ( Gre ˜no et al., 2022 ). \nTaking into account these conditions, the extraction solvent to perform \nthe metabolite extraction from the samples investigated in this study \nwas optimized. \nThus, different solvents and solvents mixtures, including methanol \n(25, 50, 75, 80, 90% in water), ethanol (25, 50, 75% in water), and \n100% water at pH 2.0 (water with small amounts of phosphoric acid) \nand 9.0 (water with sodium borate) were evaluated. The largest number \nof molecular features was obtained using 50% MeOH for positive ioni -\nzation mode, and 80% MeOH for negative ionization mode (see Table 1 ). \nHowever, as reported in Table 1 , the use of 50% MeOH in negative \nionization mode revealed 559 less features than with 80% MeOH. \nHowever, the use of 80% MeOH as solvent in positive ionization mode \ngave rise to a high variation in terms of molecular feature extraction', 'times) and subsequently, they were dried under vacuum (SpeedVac \nSPD1030, Thermo Fischer Scientific). Then, 100 mg of each cocoa \nsample were mixed with 1.5 mL of the extraction solvent (75% of \nmethanol in water). The extraction procedure was performed in a \nThermomixer (Thermomixer C Eppendorf AG, Hamburg, Germany) at \n750 rpm for 30 min at 25 \n◦\nC. The extracted samples were centrifuged at \n3500 rpm for 10 min at 25 \n◦\nC (Heraeus Fresco 21 Centrifuge, Thermo \nFischer Scientific). Finally, the supernatant was directly injected into the \nUHLC-MS system. \nFor the metabolomic sequence, each alkalized cocoa sample was \nextracted five times, and equal aliquots of each alkalized cocoa extract \n(CN, CL, CM, and CS) were mixed to prepare a quality control sample \n(QC). Moreover, a solution containing ten standards was injected during \nthe metabolomic sequence to ensure good analytical performance. \n2.4. Ultra high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry \nconditions \nAn Agilent 1290 UHPLC system coupled to a 6540 series quadrupole \ntime-of-flight (QTOF) mass spectrometer (Agilent Technologies, Ger -\nmany) equipped with a Jet Stream thermal orthogonal electrospray \nionization (ESI) source was used to carry out all the analysis. Agilent \nMass Hunter Qualitative Analysis software (B.10.00) was employed for \nMS control, data acquisition, and data analysis. \nA Zorbax Eclipse Plus C\n18 \ncolumn (100 × 2.1 mm, 1.8 μ m particle \ndiameter) was used protected by a Zorbax Eclipse Plus C\n18 \nguard column \n(5 × 2.1 mm, 1.8 μ m particle diameter) both from Agilent Technologies. \nThe chromatographic methodology and mass detection parameters were \nsimilar to previous works focused on the use of UHPL-MS for the char -\nacterization of natural products ( Avanza et al., 2021 ; Peixoto et al., \n2021 ). Elution was performed employing the following mobile phases: \nwater + 0.1% formic acid (solvent A) and acetonitrile + 0.1% formic acid \n(solvent B) in positive ionization, and water + formic acid 0.01% (A) \nand acetonitrile + formic acid 0.01% (B) in negative ionization mode. In \nboth cases, the gradient was as follows: 0 – 30% B in 0 – 7 min; 30 – 80% in \n7 – 9 min, 80 – 100% in 9 – 11 min, 100% B in 11 – 13 min and 0% B in \n13 – 14 min. The flow rate was 0.5 mL/min, the column temperature was \n40 \n◦\nC and the sample injection volume was 2 μ L. \nThe mass spectrometer was used in positive and negative ESI modes \nwith the following parameters: capillary voltage, 3000 V; nozzle \nvoltage, 0 V; nebulizer pressure, 40 psi; sheath gas flow 11 L/min and \ntemperature 350 \n◦\nC; drying gas flow rate, 8 L/min and gas temperature, \n300 \n◦\nC, skimmer voltage, 45 V; fragmentor voltage, 110 V; octapole \nvoltage, 750 V. MS and auto MS mode was set to acquire m/z values \nranging from 25 to 1100 at a scan rate of 5 spectra per second. MS/MS \nanalyses were performed by fragmenting the selected precursor ions \nwith voltages of 20 and 40 V in the collision chamber. A solution of two \nreference ions was used to allow proper mass correction, namely, m/z \n121.0508 (C\n5\nH\n4\nN\n4\n) and 922.0097 (C\n18\nH\n18\nO\n6\nN\n3\nP\n3\nF\n24\n) in positive mode, \nand m/z 119.0363 (C\n5\nH\n4\nN\n4\n) and 966.0007 (C\n18\nH\n18\nO\n6\nN\n3\nP\n3\nF\n24 \n+\nformate) in negative mode. \n2.5. Metabolomics sequence \nBlanks and the QC sample were injected at the beginning and end of \nthe analytical sequence to assure the good stability of the system. Then, \nfour groups of samples and five replicates of each group were randomly \ninjected in triplicate. Every six samples a QC sample was also injected to \nassess the stability of the analyses. Moreover, through the metabolomics \nsequence, the mix solution containing ten standards was injected to \nevaluate mass accuracy and retention time-shifting. \n2.6. Data processing and multivariate analysis \nData treatment was carried out using Mass Hunter Qualitative \n(MHQ) (B.10.00) and Profiler Professional (MPP) (B.07.00) software', 'remarkable precision and sensitivity ( Tong et al., 2021 ). While\nnumerous studies have employed LC-MS/MS to analyze the chemical\ncomponents in chocolate ( de Dias et al., 2023 ) and cocoa beans ( Bacca-\nVillota, Acu ˜na-García, Sierra-Guevara, Cano, & Hidalgo, 2023 ), only a\nfew articles have documented the comprehensive or the discovery of\nnew compounds resulting from the alkalization process ( Gre ˜no, Herrero,\nCifuentes, Marina, & Castro-Puyana, 2022 ). Cocoa powders typically\nconsist of a mixture of numerous compounds, resulting in complex mass\nspectrometry data after LC-MS/MS analysis, which difficult the inter-\npretation. The use of molecular networking (MN) can aid in data\ninterpretation. MN is a method for visualizing tandem MS/MS data that\ncalculates the similarity degree of the MS/MS spectra and organizes\nthem into a network, connecting compounds with similar structural el-\nements through edges ( Tong et al., 2021 ). This technique is valuable for\nanalyzing complex chemical compositions, identifying quality, trace-\nability, and safety biomarkers, and detecting contaminants and adul-\nterants in foods ( Li et al., 2023 ). It has become essential for examining\nthe structures of compounds found in plant-based foods, enabling the\nidentification of multiple unannotated compounds within a single group\n( Tong et al., 2021 ).\nThus, this study aimed to assess the metabolic differences between\nalkalized and non-alkalized (natural) cocoa powders using a non-\ntargeted high-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-\nflight mass spectrometry (HPLC-QTOF-MS)-based metabolomic\napproach. These differences in the metabolic profile may account for\nchanges in the nutritional and sensory characteristics of cocoa as well as\nits bioactivity.\n2. Materials and methods\n2.1. Cocoa samples\nFive non-alkalized cocoa powders from Venezuela (C1), Ivory Coast\n(C3), Peru (C4), Dominican Republic (C5), and West Africa (C6) and two\nalkalized cocoa powders from Ivory Coast (C2) and West Africa (C7)\nwere purchased from the Spanish market. Commercial cocoa varieties\nthat did not differ significantly in terms of nutritional composition were\nsought.\n2.2. Sample preparation\nMetabolites were extracted from cocoa powder using ultrasound\ntechnology as previously described by Razola-Díaz et al. (2023) . First,\nthe cocoa samples were defatted with hexane (10 ml hexane/ 1 g cocoa\npowder), vortexed for 1 min, sonicated in an ultrasound bath (Bandelin,\nSonorex, RK52, Berlin, Germany) for 5 min, centrifuged (OHAUS,\nFC5718R, Germany) at 9960 rcf for 5 min, and evaporated under ni-\ntrogen. This procedure was repeated twice.

After peak alignment (retention time window of 0.15 min, a mass 
tolerance of 0.02 Da, and a mass window of 15 ppm) of the extracted 
molecular features using MPP, molecular feature filtering was per -
formed, applying a minimum absolute abundance of 10,000 counts, an 
ion number of 2, and all charges permitted. Moreover, molecular fea -
tures present in 100% of the QC samples with a coefficient of variation 
below 30% were selected for statistical analysis. Multivariate statistical 
analysis was performed with SIMCA 14.0 software (Umetrics, Umeå, 
Sweden). Data was centered and divided by the square root of the 
standard deviation as a scaling factor (Pareto scaling). Both, unsuper -
vised principal component analysis (PCA), to evaluate clustering in the 
analyzed samples, and partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-

2.7. Metabolite identification 
Identification was based on the molecular features which presented 
significant differences in the PLS-DA model. This process was performed 
using the CEU Mass Mediator ( Gil de la Fuente et al., 2018 ), and FooDB 
database ( http://foodb.ca ) considering an error of 30 ppm. Metabolites 
showing significant differences among groups and those commercially 
available were purchased and analyzed under the same experimental 
conditions. The comparison of retention times and MS/MS fragmenta -
tion was carried out to confirm the metabolite identification. When 
standards were not commercially available, experimental MS/MS 
spectra were compared to those described in the HMDB database, 
literature, and predicted spectra in CFM-ID ( https://cfmid.wishartlab. 
com/ ). 
3. Results and discussion 
3.1. Optimization of the extraction procedure 
One of the most crucial steps in an untargeted metabolomic analysis 
is sample preparation since it will directly influence the results obtained. 
Ideally, the sample preparation should be as non-selective as possible to 
ensure a broad coverage of the metabolome. 
The approach followed for optimizing the extraction procedure was 
based on the achievement of the greatest number of molecular features 
from cocoa samples. Previous results obtained by our research group 
related to the use of an HPLC-MS-based metabolomics approach to 
reveal cocoa powder adulterations demonstrated that a defatting step 
(to remove fatty acid content), the use of a thermomixer (as it enabled 
the control of temperature), and 30 min of extraction time were the most 
appropriate conditions to carry out the extraction ( Gre ˜no et al., 2022 ). 
Taking into account these conditions, the extraction solvent to perform 
the metabolite extraction from the samples investigated in this study 
was optimized. 
Thus, different solvents and solvents mixtures, including methanol 
(25, 50, 75, 80, 90% in water), ethanol (25, 50, 75% in water), and 
100% water at pH 2.0 (water with small amounts of phosphoric acid) 
and 9.0 (water with sodium borate) were evaluated. The largest number 
of molecular features was obtained using 50% MeOH for positive ioni -
zation mode, and 80% MeOH for negative ionization mode (see Table 1 ). 
However, as reported in Table 1 , the use of 50% MeOH in negative 
ionization mode revealed 559 less features than with 80% MeOH. 
However, the use of 80% MeOH as solvent in positive ionization mode 
gave rise to a high variation in terms of molecular feature extraction","Metabolites were extracted from cocoa powder using ultrasound technology. First, the cocoa samples were defatted with hexane (10 ml hexane/ 1 g cocoa powder), vortexed for 1 min, sonicated in an ultrasound bath for 5 min, centrifuged at 9960 rcf for 5 min, and evaporated under nitrogen. This procedure was repeated twice. Extraction was performed by adding 5 ml of a mixture of acetone/water/acetic acid (70/29.5/0.5%), vortexed for 2 min, sonicated in an ultrasound bath at a frequency of 35 kHz for 5 min, and centrifuged at 9960 rcf for 5 min.

In most of omic applications, prior to the interpretation or\nanalysis of the data collected, the data often undergo different\npre-processing steps (e.g. scattering, baseline corrections,\npeak alignment) allowing the signal from different samples\nto be compared and further used in routine applications\n(Cevallos-Cevallos et al. 2009;W i s h a r t2008;K h a k i m o v\net al. 2014, 2015; Skov et al. 2014; Gromski et al. 2015).\nThe choice of the most appropriate method (e.g. algorithm,\npre-processing) for each of these steps is highly dependent on\nthe sample, instrumentation technique and purpose of analy-\nsis, and is beyond the purpose of this review. A recent article\nby Khakimov and collaborators provide with a summary of\nthe current MVA methods used or applied in omics\n(Khakimov et al. 2015). This review also provides with a\nguide of practical and pragmatic tools to validate and to deal\nadvantageously with data from more than one analytical plat-\nform, as well as emphasises the need for complementary cor-\nrelation studies within and between blocks of data to ensure\nproper data handling, interpretation and dissemination\n(Cevallos-Cevallos et al. 2009;W i s h a r t2008;K h a k i m o v\net al. 2014, 2015;S k o ve ta l . 2014; Gromski et al. 2015).\nExamples on the Current Status of Metabolomics\nApplications in Grape and Wine Research\nAs metabolomics is becoming an emerging field in grape and\nwine research, different analytical techniques (e.g. NMR, GC-\nMS, HPLC etc.) were used to produce information-rich, high-\nly reliable and reproducible data in a non-targeted or global\nway where MV A is often applied to analyse and interpret the\ndata generated. Examples of such applications in viticulture\nand wine making published by several researchers are provid-\ned below. Note that the use of metabolomics to classify wines\nfrom different geographical origins or varieties is not ad-\ndressed in this overview.\nMetabolomics Applied in Viticultural Studies and Grape\nComposition\nIt has been reported that the analysis of grape ( Vitis vinifera)\nberries at the transcriptomic, proteomic and metabolomic\nlevels can provide great insights into molecular events under-\nlying berry development as well as postharvest drying\n(withering) (Zamboni et al. 2010). However, the large and\nvery different sets of data produced by this type of\ninvestigations are difficult to integrate using traditional\nmethodologies. Zamboni et al. (2010) have identified putative\nstage-specific biomarkers for berry development and wither-\ning as well as integrating systems-level studies of these pro-\ncesses using omics approaches. An integrated transcriptomic,\nproteomic and metabolomic approach using two different\nstrategies, namely hypothesis free and hypothesis driven,\nwas used (Zamboni et al. 2010). In this study, a multistep\nhypothesis-free approach was applied to the data sourced from\nfour grape developmental stages and three withering intervals,\nwith integration achieved using a hierarchical clustering strat-\negy based on the multivariate bidirectional orthogonal projec-\ntions to latent structures technique (Zamboni et al. 2010). This\napproach allowed the identification of stage-specific function-\nal networks of linked transcripts, proteins and metabolites,\nproviding important insights into the key molecular processes\nthat determine the quality characteristics of the wine (Zamboni\net al. 2010). The proposed methodology also allowed the iden-\ntification of transcripts and proteins that were modulated\nTable 1 Characteristics of analytical techniques using in grape and wine metabolomics\nTechnique Characteristics References\nNuclear magnetic resonance\n(NMR)\nRobust and highly reproducible, provides', 'The questions behind most omics studies require the\nutilisation of untargeted analytical methods as well as the ex-\ntraction of as much information as possible from these plat-\nforms (Munck 2007; Kelly et al. 2011; Capozzi and Bordoni\n2013;G a r c i a - C a n a se ta l .2012; Castro-Puyana et al. 2013;\nCevallos-Cevallos et al. 2009; Wishart 2008; Roullier-Gall\net al. 2014; Silvestri et al. 2014).\nMetabolomics is generally defined as the study of as many\nmetabolites as possible in a system (Cevallos-Cevallos et al.\n2009; Wishart 2008; Roullier-Gall et al. 2014; Silvestri et al.\n2014). More specifically, it has been defined as a field in\nomics research concerned with the high-throughput identifi-\nca\ntion and quantification of small molecule metabolites in the\nmetabolome (Cevallos-Cevallos et al. 2009; Wishart 2008),\nwhere the metabolome is defined as the collection of all small\nmolecule metabolites or chemicals that can be found in a cell,\norgan, or organism (Cevallos-Cevallos et al. 2009; Wishart\n2008; Roullier-Gall et al. 2014 ; Silvestri et al. 2014).\nFigure 1 illustrates the steps in wine metabolomics, from wine\nto the end use application.\nThe Hardware and Software Used in Metabolomics\nThe sheer size of the generated data in omics often becomes\ntoo big to be effectively evaluated by conventional univariate\napproaches and requires multivariate data analysis (MV A) and\npattern recognition (PR) methods that utilise all measured var-\niables simultaneously. These methods are able to identify un-\nderlying latent factors that carry information (e.g. biochemis-\ntry, chemistry, process) about the sample (Wishart 2008;\nKhakimov et al. 2014, 2015;S k o ve ta l . 2014; Allen et al.\n2003;D u n na n dE l l i s2005; Nielsen and Oliver 2005;O l i v e r\net al. 1998, 2002; Sumner et al. 2003; Sweetlove et al. 2004;\nCozzolino 2011;U n g e r2009; Wolfender 2009; Roullier-Gall\net al. 2015;H o n g 2011; Gromski et al. 2015).

By employing this approach, we can gain a comprehensive un-\nderstanding of how various treatments, such as alkalization, impact the\nquality and safety of foods, as well as assess the preservation, trans-\nformation, or reduction of bioactive compounds that may have a posi-\ntive effect on consumer health. Moreover, exploring the impact of\nalkalization on the metabolic profile of cocoa would enable us to opti-\nmize production processes and enhance the quality of the final product,\nthereby improving its overall quality, safety, and nutritional value.\nOther studies have investigated the effect of alkalization on the\ncomposition of cocoa by controlling the parameters of this process\n( Gre ˜no et al., 2022 ; Rodríguez et al., 2009 ), however, in the present\nwork, the focus was on elucidating the effects of alkalization on different\ncommercial cocoa powders, for which the specific parameters used in\nthe process are unknown. This strengthens the results obtained, making\nthem more applicable to consumers, as they reflect the commercial re-\nality that can be found in the market. Despite the variability in the\ntreatments applied and other factors, such as origin, certain trends in the\ncomposition of cocoa associated with the alkalization process were\nobserved. Further research is needed to elucidate how other factors,\nsuch as the origin of cocoa, can affect its composition.\n4. Conclusion\nIn summary, this study investigated how alkalization affects the\ncompositions of different commercial cocoa powders. It is worth high-\nlighting the advantage of using a non-targeted method, as it allows for a\nbroad coverage of metabolites, enabling the identification of several\nsecondary metabolites, such as polyphenols, alkaloids terpenoids or\neven fungal-related metabolites, lipids and amino acids. To the best of\nour knowledge, 20 metabolites have were tentatively characterized for\nthe first time in cocoa. Despite the variability between commercial co-\ncoas, changes in various metabolites have been identified between\nnatural and alkalized cocoas, elucidating alterations induced by the\nalkalization process. Specifically, phenolic compounds, which are\nessential contributors to cocoa health properties, showed significant\nreductions in alkalized cocoas, consistent with previous studies. Lipid\nderivatives, peptides, and amino acids also exhibit fluctuations,\nreflecting the interaction between the alkalization process and cocoa\ncomposition. Generally, fatty acids and derivatives tended to increase\nwith alkalization, whereas lysophosphatidylethanolamines, amino\nacids, and derivatives tended to decrease. Lastly, we report for the first\ntime the reduction of salsolinol, a potential neurotoxin, after alkaliza-\ntion. Furthermore, this study highlighted the utility of advanced\nanalytical techniques, multivariate statistical analysis and FBMN, to\nanalyze, identify and annotate food compounds, thus revealing the\ncomplex metabolic signature of cocoa. Additionally, these techniques\ncould be useful for identifyng biomarkers related to the alkalization\nprocess, which could be employed in cocoa authentication.

Positive ion\nelectron impact spectra at 70 eV were recorded in the\nm/z range 35 – 350 for scan runs. Selected ion monitor-\ning (SIM) was used for the relative quantification of tar-\ngeted metabolites. The n-alkane series (alkane standard\nsolution C 8-C20, Fluka, Sigma-Aldrich) was run using\nthe same method to benchmark the retention indices.\nThe identity of compounds was verified by comparison\nwith Kovats retention indices and mass spectra with\nthose contained in the NBS, Wiley and AWRI GC-MS\ndatabases, and in an “in house ” database of spectra of\nauthentic standards. A matching of at least the 90 % was\nconsidered for aldehydes, alchools, monoterpenes and\nC13-norisoprenoids, while for the other metabolites a\nmatching of at least 75 % was used.\nLC/GC-MS data processing\nLC-MS chromatograms were transformed into the\nnetCDF format using the Bruker Daltonics Esquire v5.2\nand Data Analysis v3.2 software (Bruker Daltonik GmbH,\nBremen, Germany).\nThe open-source software MZmine v2.2 (http://mzmine.\nsourceforge.net) was used to extract the data, which was\nprocessed by median fold change normalization before\nlog transformation and mean centering. The matrix effect\ndid not substantially affect the relative quantification of\nsecondary metabolites under our analytical conditions\n(data not shown) as we have previously shown [15]. In\norder to further evaluate the performances of HPLC-ESI-\nMS for relative quantitation, the HPLC-ESI-MS relative\nquantitation of the more abundant metabolites were com-\npared with those with obtained by HPLC-DAD, which is a\nquantitative techniques (Additional file 3).\nGC-MS chromatograms were analyzed using Agilent\nC1701 Chemstation software. Peaks were automatically\nintegrated and the results were checked manually. The\ndata representing 63 samples × 48 identified molecules\nwere normalized by internal standard peak areas to\navoid differences in detection efficiencies. Monoterpene\nand sesquiterpene compounds were normalized to the\nα-copaene peak area, norisoprenoids to the d3-β-ionone\npeak area, and remaining compounds to the d13-hexanol\npeak area. The resulting data set was autoscaled before\nanalysis.\nMicroarray data\nThe transcriptomic data from seven out of eleven vineyards\nsampled in the 2008 growing season (BA, CS, BM, MN,\nFA, AM and PM) from our previous work [14] were re-\ntrieved and reanalyzed in the present work. Briefly, as previ-\nously described, the gene expr ession microarray data were\nobtained by hybridization to a NimbleGen microarray\n090818_Vitus_exp_HX12 (Roche, NimbleGen), which con-\ntains probes targeting 29,549 predicted grapevine genes,\nrepresenting 98.6 % of the genes predicted from the V1 an-\nnotation of the 12X grapevine genome (http://srs.ebi.ac.uk/)\nand 19,091 random probes as negative controls. The\nexpression data were analyzed using T-MeV v4.8.1 software\n(http://sourceforge.net/projects/mev-tm4/) and were nor-\nmalized based on the mean center genes/rows adjustment,\nwith Pearson’s correlation metric chosen as the statistical\nmetric. The obtained data set was log-transformed and\nmean centered prior to analysis.\nData analysis and modelling\nA preliminary data analysis based on ANOVA was\np e r f o r m e dt oh i g h l i g h tt h er o l eo fv i n t a g ea n dp r o -\nducer on the variation of each single measured me-\ntabolite. Since the design of experiments was characterized']","cultivated in seven different vineyards, over a three-year
trial period, together with the development of statistical
tools to overcome the dominant vintage effects, allowed
us to see a terroir-dependent plasticity of the metabo-
lome and of the related transcripts, which persists over
several vintages. Within the various metabolite classes,
clear differences in the terroir dependent plasticity were
seen: stilbenes, anthocyanins, flavonoids and some VOCs
(especially sesquiterpenes) proved to be the more plastic
component of the metabolome, while other component,
such as the procyanindins and flavan-3-ols were much
more stable. On the other side, only weak relationship
were observed between the metabolome and individual
terroir-specific features (including soil composition and
viticultural practices).
