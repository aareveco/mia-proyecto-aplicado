ABSTRACT The absorption and metabolism of anthocyanins (ACN) in humans was studied in four elderly women
given 12 g elderberry extract (EBX) (720 mg total ACN), and six elderly women given 189 g lowbush blueberry (BB)
(690 mg total ACN). The two major ACN in EBX, cyanidin-3-glucoside and cyanidin-3-sambubioside, as well as four
metabolites: 1) peonidin 3-glucoside, 2) peonidin 3-sambubioside, 3) peonidin monoglucuronide, and 4) cyanidin-
3-glucoside monoglucuronide were identiﬁed in urine withi n4ho f consumption using HPLC-MS/MS with
diode-array detector detection and retention time. Total EBX ACN excretion was 554 /H1100690
/H9262g (mean /H11006SD, n /H110054)
(0.077% of intake/4 h, wt/wt). In 5 of 6 women fed BB, urine samples contained ACN, which were identiﬁed as the
original forms based upon comparisons to the BB food sample, which contained 24 ACN, 22 of which were
identiﬁed by HPLC-MS/MS. Reasonable correlations between BB and urine proportions of the different ACN were
obtained except for ACN arabinosides. Total urinary excretion during the ﬁrst 6 h was 23.2 /H1100610.9
/H9262g (mean /H11006SD,
n /H110055) (0.004% of intake/6 h, wt/wt). Plasma ACN levels were below detection limits using 2 mL plasma in women
that consumed BB. This study demonstrates for the ﬁrst time that in vivo methylation of cyanidin to peonidin and
glucuronide conjugate formation occurs after people consume ACN and demonstrates the low absorption and
excretion of ACN compared with other ﬂavonoids. J. Nutr. 132: 1865–1871, 2002.

Anthocyanins (ACN) are part of a large and widespread
group of plant constituents known collectively as ﬂavonoids.
They are mainly distributed among ﬂowers, fruits and vegeta-
bles and are responsible for the bright colors that occur in
ﬂower petals, fruits and other plant organelles (1,2). ACN can
be used as natural colorants (3), but their use has been limited
because of their poor stability. As a potential major compo-
nent of our daily diet (4), more and more research has con-
centrated on their biological activities and possible health
beneﬁts in protecting against some chronic diseases, including
cancer, cardio- and cerebrovascular, atherosclerosis, and dia-
betes. Some of these biological activities and protective func-
tions may be attributable to their high antioxidant capacities
(5). Studies on antioxidant capacities of ACN revealed that
they could act in scavenging free radicals (6 – 8), metal che-
lation (4), protein binding (9), and other mechanisms.
To evaluate the health beneﬁts of ACN in humans, the
bioavailibility including absorption, distribution, metabolism,
and excretion must be known. It is also necessary to consider
the metabolites (such as ring-ﬁssion products produced by
microorganisms; conjugated and methylated derivatives, etc.)
instead of considering only the original form of ACN, as the
concentration of the original forms in human body is much
less than what was consumed (10). Metabolites may contrib-
ute, to some extent, to the positive health effects. However,
information about metabolism of ACN is quite limited.
As early as 1933, Horwitt (11) observed that the urine of
rabbits became highly pigmented after feeding ACN from
grapes. He concluded that small quantities of the grape ACN
or anthocyanidins were absorbed and passed through to the
circulation. ACN, which are present in plants as glycosides,
were long assumed not to be absorbed in the human body","The provided context discusses the absorption and metabolism of anthocyanidins, which are present in plants as glycosides.

ABSTRACT The absorption and metabolism of anthocyanins (ACN) in humans was studied in four elderly women
given 12 g elderberry extract (EBX) (720 mg total ACN), and six elderly women given 189 g lowbush blueberry (BB)
(690 mg total ACN). The two major ACN in EBX, cyanidin-3-glucoside and cyanidin-3-sambubioside, as well as four
metabolites: 1) peonidin 3-glucoside, 2) peonidin 3-sambubioside, 3) peonidin monoglucuronide, and 4) cyanidin-
3-glucoside monoglucuronide were identiﬁed in urine withi n4ho f consumption using HPLC-MS/MS with
diode-array detector detection and retention time. Total EBX ACN excretion was 554 /H1100690
/H9262g (mean /H11006SD, n /H110054)
(0.077% of intake/4 h, wt/wt). In 5 of 6 women fed BB, urine samples contained ACN, which were identiﬁed as the
original forms based upon comparisons to the BB food sample, which contained 24 ACN, 22 of which were
identiﬁed by HPLC-MS/MS. Reasonable correlations between BB and urine proportions of the different ACN were
obtained except for ACN arabinosides. Total urinary excretion during the ﬁrst 6 h was 23.2 /H1100610.9
/H9262g (mean /H11006SD,
n /H110055) (0.004% of intake/6 h, wt/wt). Plasma ACN levels were below detection limits using 2 mL plasma in women
that consumed BB. This study demonstrates for the ﬁrst time that in vivo methylation of cyanidin to peonidin and
glucuronide conjugate formation occurs after people consume ACN and demonstrates the low absorption and
excretion of ACN compared with other ﬂavonoids. J. Nutr. 132: 1865–1871, 2002.
KEY WORDS:
● anthocyanin ● metabolite ● elderberry (Sambucus nigra)
● blueberry (Vaccinium angustifolium)
Anthocyanins (ACN) are part of a large and widespread
group of plant constituents known collectively as ﬂavonoids.
They are mainly distributed among ﬂowers, fruits and vegeta-
bles and are responsible for the bright colors that occur in
ﬂower petals, fruits and other plant organelles (1,2). ACN can
be used as natural colorants (3), but their use has been limited
because of their poor stability. As a potential major compo-
nent of our daily diet (4), more and more research has con-
centrated on their biological activities and possible health
beneﬁts in protecting against some chronic diseases, including
cancer, cardio- and cerebrovascular, atherosclerosis, and dia-
betes. Some of these biological activities and protective func-
tions may be attributable to their high antioxidant capacities
(5). Studies on antioxidant capacities of ACN revealed that
they could act in scavenging free radicals (6 – 8), metal che-
lation (4), protein binding (9), and other mechanisms.
To evaluate the health beneﬁts of ACN in humans, the
bioavailibility including absorption, distribution, metabolism,
and excretion must be known. It is also necessary to consider
the metabolites (such as ring-ﬁssion products produced by
microorganisms; conjugated and methylated derivatives, etc.)
instead of considering only the original form of ACN, as the
concentration of the original forms in human body is much
less than what was consumed (10). Metabolites may contrib-
ute, to some extent, to the positive health effects. However,
information about metabolism of ACN is quite limited.
As early as 1933, Horwitt (11) observed that the urine of
rabbits became highly pigmented after feeding ACN from
grapes. He concluded that small quantities of the grape ACN
or anthocyanidins were absorbed and passed through to the
circulation. ACN, which are present in plants as glycosides,
were long assumed not to be absorbed in the human body",The main focus of the research is the absorption and metabolism of anthocyanins in elderly women after consumption of elderberry or blueberry.,0.9999999999666667,1.0

In 5 of 6 women fed BB, urine samples contained ACN, which were identiﬁed as the\noriginal forms based upon comparisons to the BB food sample, which contained 24 ACN, 22 of which were\nidentiﬁed by HPLC-MS/MS. Reasonable correlations between BB and urine proportions of the different ACN were\nobtained except for ACN arabinosides. Total urinary excretion during the ﬁrst 6 h was 23.2 /H1100610.9\n/H9262g (mean /H11006SD,\nn /H110055) (0.004% of intake/6 h, wt/wt).

This study demonstrates for the ﬁrst time that in vivo methylation of cyanidin to peonidin and\nglucuronide conjugate formation occurs after people consume ACN and demonstrates the low absorption and\nexcretion of ACN compared with other ﬂavonoids.

Nutr. 132: 1865–1871, 2002.\nKEY WORDS:\n● anthocyanin ● metabolite ● elderberry (Sambucus nigra)\n● blueberry (Vaccinium angustifolium)\nAnthocyanins (ACN) are part of a large and widespread\ngroup of plant constituents known collectively as ﬂavonoids.\nThey are mainly distributed among ﬂowers, fruits and vegeta-\nbles and are responsible for the bright colors that occur in\nﬂower petals, fruits and other plant organelles (1,2). ACN can\nbe used as natural colorants (3), but their use has been limited\nbecause of their poor stability. As a potential major compo-\nnent of our daily diet (4), more and more research has con-\ncentrated on their biological activities and possible health\nbeneﬁts in protecting against some chronic diseases, including\ncancer, cardio- and cerebrovascular, atherosclerosis, and dia-\nbetes. Some of these biological activities and protective func-\ntions may be attributable to their high antioxidant capacities\n(5). Studies on antioxidant capacities of ACN revealed that\nthey could act in scavenging free radicals (6 – 8), metal che-\nlation (4), protein binding (9), and other mechanisms.\nTo evaluate the health beneﬁts of ACN in humans, the\nbioavailibility including absorption, distribution, metabolism,\nand excretion must be known. It is also necessary to consider\nthe metabolites (such as ring-ﬁssion products produced by\nmicroorganisms; conjugated and methylated derivatives, etc.)\ninstead of considering only the original form of ACN, as the\nconcentration of the original forms in human body is much\nless than what was consumed (10). Metabolites may contrib-\nute, to some extent, to the positive health effects. However,\ninformation about metabolism of ACN is quite limited.\nAs early as 1933, Horwitt (11) observed that the urine of\nrabbits became highly pigmented after feeding ACN from\ngrapes. He concluded that small quantities of the grape ACN\nor anthocyanidins were absorbed and passed through to the\ncirculation. ACN, which are present in plants as glycosides,\nwere long assumed not to be absorbed in the human body', 'or anthocyanidins were absorbed and passed through to the\ncirculation. ACN, which are present in plants as glycosides,\nwere long assumed not to be absorbed in the human body\nunless they were hydrolyzed by intestinal microorganisms. Re-\ncently, several papers on the absorption and metabolism of\ndietary ACN have shown that ACN can be absorbed in\nexperimental animals and humans as glycosides (12–23).\nWe have previously detected the intact glycoside forms in\nblood and urine of humans after consuming elderberry ACN\n(16 –17). Murkovic and coworkers (20 –22) studied the absorp-\ntion and metabolism of ACN in elderberry juice, and showed that\nACN, though in low concentration, could be detected in blood\nand urine as intact glycosides.

What is peonidin monoglucuronide in relation to other anthocyanins?,"['the conjugated forms of ACN presents particular challenges in\nthat ACN are unstable at neutral pH. The ACN disappeared\ncompletely when we incubated the plasma samples for 3 h.\nBecause previous investigators have relied on detecting the\nconjugated forms using the difference in ACN concentrations\nbefore and after incubation with\n/H9252-glucuronidase, small\namounts of degradation during the incubation might mask any\nconjugates that were present.\nIn this study, we still do not know how the peonidin\nmonoglucuronide is formed. Two possible pathways could de-\nscribe the formation of this metabolite ( Fig. 6). Cyanidin-3-\nglucoside could be absorbed intact and some methylated to\nform peonidin-3-glucoside in the liver (Fig. 6; Pathway 1).\nEither cyanidin-3-glucoside or peonidin-3-glucoside could\nserve as a substrate for UDP-glucose dehydrogenase to form\nthe corresponding glucuronide from the glucose form. For this\nto occur, cyanidin-3-glucoside or peonidin-3-glucoside would\nhave to serve as a substrate for the enzyme UDP-glucose\ndehydrogenase, which converts UDP-glucose into UDP-gluc-\nuronic acid. UDP-glucose dehydrogenase (GDH) is a unique\nenzyme pathway which furnishes in vertebrates the UDP-\nglucuronic acid for numerous transferases, including those of\nglycosaminoglycan synthesis and xenobiotics elimination\n(39). GDH is present in both the liver and the small intestine\nof the rats, guinea pigs, and mice (40,41). This hypothesis\nwould explain the presence of peonidin-glucuronide. This\npathway seems likely since we have found all of these com-\npounds in urine.\nA second possibility (Fig. 6, Pathway 2) is that cyanidin-\n3-glucoside is hydrolyzed to the aglycone in the intestine and\nabsorbed. In the liver, the cyanidin could be methylated and\nconjugated to form peonidin monoglucuronide. However, cy-\nanidin is unstable in plasma and may form protocatechuic acid\n(14). No cyanidin aglycone has been detected in the plasma of\nhumans (15) or rats (14), but it has been demonstrated in rat\njejunum (14). If these reactions occurred, we would expect to\nﬁnd peonidin aglycone and cyanidin glucuronide, which we\nhave not detected. However, a challenge in all of this work is\nthat we are generally working near the limits of detection of\nFIGURE 6 Glucuronide conjugated forms from cyanidin-3-glu-\ncoside.

On\nthe representative chromatogram of subject G (0 –2 h), one\npeak appeared with a retention time of 34 min ( Fig. 3A, Peak\n3) and with an m/z of 463.1 and a daughter fragmentary peak\nfrom MS/MS with an m/z of 301.2 (Fig. 3 B). Based upon the\nm/z of 301.2, we assumed this peak to be peonidin glycoside or\nanother methylated form of cyanidin glycoside. We compared\nthe chromatogram of the mixed ACN standards under the\nsame experimental conditions (Fig. 1 C) and found that the\nretention time of this peak was identical to that of peonidin-\n3-glucoside, conﬁrming this peak to be peonidin-3-glucoside, a\nmethylated form of cyanidin-3-glucoside. This observation\nalso supports the conclusion from other studies, which dem-\nonstrated that for several ﬂavonoids with 3 /H11032,4 /H11032-dihydroxyla-\ntion of ring B, methylation tends to occur at the 3/H11032-O-position\n(26). Another small peak appeared at 33.1 min (Fig. 3 A, Peak\n4) with an m/z of 595.9, and a fragment ion MS/MS of 301.2\n(Fig. 3B). From the results above, we have shown that cyani-\ndin can be transformed to peonidin, so we contend that this\npeak may also contain peonidin as its aglycone. The molecular\nweight of a sambubiosidose residue is 294.2, which is the\ndifference between the m/z of the parent and daughter ion.\nThus, this peak at 33.1 min appears to be the methylated form\nof cyanidin-3-sambubioside, the other major ACN in elder-\nberry. Another two peaks (Peaks 5 and 6) were not identi ﬁed\nbecause they do not have typical ACN MS spectral data.\nFrom the chromatogram and MS data of subject B (2– 4 h),\na small peak with a retention time at 35.5 min is notable (Fig.\n4A, Peak 7). It had an m/z of 477.1 and a fragment ion with\nan m/z of 301.2 (Fig. 4 A). The fragment peak indicated that\nthis peak was also an ACN containing peonidin aglycone. An\nm/z of 176 for the substitution group is indicative of a gluc-\nuronide residue, which is a very common conjugated form of\nﬂavonoids in humans (26). This peak may be peonidin mono-\nglucuronide. However, we could not determine the exact site\nof glucuronidation on the peonidin from the available data.\nTwo other small peaks (Peaks 8 and 9) which eluted earlier\nthan Peak 7 were not identi ﬁed because of their low concen-\ntrations. There was another glucuronide conjugated form with\na retention time of 19.8 min on the subject G chromatogram\n(0–2 h) (Fig. 4 B, Peak 10). MS spectral results indicated an\nm/z of 625.3 and MS/MS data gave two fragments with an m/z\nof 463.1 and 287.2. (Fig. 4 B). An m/z of 287.2 is typical for\ncyanidin aglycone, and 463.1 minus 287.2 is 176, which is\nindicative of a glucuronide residue. The difference between\n463.1 and the m/z of the parent compound (625.3) is 162.2,\nwhich matches that of a hexose residue. Because only cyani-\ndin-3-glucoside is present in elderberry, this peak should be\nthe monoglucuronide form of cyanidin-3-glucoside, a com-\npound which has four free hydroxyl groups. The exact glucu-\nronidation site on cyanidin is not known. Two other peaks\nin the same chromatogram (Peaks 11 and 12) were not\nidentiﬁed. They were not typical ACN based on their MS\nspectral data. Not all metabolites were detected in all\nsubjects. A summary of the MS data and total urinary\nexcretion is shown in Table 1 .\nBlueberry study. Urine samples from the ﬁve women who\nconsumed blueberry had ACN in their urine. However, the\nACN concentrations were much lower than those in the\nwomen who consumed elderberry.

We used the blueberry\nFIGURE 3 Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (MS) anal-\nysis of anthocyanins (ACN) metabolites in the urine sample from subject\nG( 0–2 h).

that ACN are unstable at neutral pH. The ACN disappeared
completely when we incubated the plasma samples for 3 h.
Because previous investigators have relied on detecting the
conjugated forms using the difference in ACN concentrations
before and after incubation with
/H9252-glucuronidase, small
amounts of degradation during the incubation might mask any
conjugates that were present.
In this study, we still do not know how the peonidin
monoglucuronide is formed. Two possible pathways could de-
scribe the formation of this metabolite ( Fig. 6). Cyanidin-3-
glucoside could be absorbed intact and some methylated to
form peonidin-3-glucoside in the liver (Fig. 6; Pathway 1).
Either cyanidin-3-glucoside or peonidin-3-glucoside could
serve as a substrate for UDP-glucose dehydrogenase to form
the corresponding glucuronide from the glucose form. For this
to occur, cyanidin-3-glucoside or peonidin-3-glucoside would
have to serve as a substrate for the enzyme UDP-glucose
dehydrogenase, which converts UDP-glucose into UDP-gluc-
uronic acid. UDP-glucose dehydrogenase (GDH) is a unique
enzyme pathway which furnishes in vertebrates the UDP-
glucuronic acid for numerous transferases, including those of
glycosaminoglycan synthesis and xenobiotics elimination
(39). GDH is present in both the liver and the small intestine
of the rats, guinea pigs, and mice (40,41). This hypothesis
would explain the presence of peonidin-glucuronide. This
pathway seems likely since we have found all of these com-
pounds in urine.
A second possibility (Fig. 6, Pathway 2) is that cyanidin-
3-glucoside is hydrolyzed to the aglycone in the intestine and
absorbed. In the liver, the cyanidin could be methylated and
conjugated to form peonidin monoglucuronide. However, cy-
anidin is unstable in plasma and may form protocatechuic acid
(14). No cyanidin aglycone has been detected in the plasma of
humans (15) or rats (14), but it has been demonstrated in rat
jejunum (14). If these reactions occurred, we would expect to
ﬁnd peonidin aglycone and cyanidin glucuronide, which we
have not detected. However, a challenge in all of this work is
that we are generally working near the limits of detection of

solution) and mobile phase B (pure methanol). The ﬂow rate was 1
mL/min and detection was at 520 nm. The gradient system used was
as follows: 0 –2 min, 5% B; 2 –10 min, 5–20% B; 10 –15 min, 20% B;
15–30 min, 20 –30% B; 30 –35 min, 30% B; 35 –50 min, 30 – 45% B;

Low-resolution electrospray mass spectrometry was performed with an
Esquire-LC Mass Spectrometer (MS) (Bruker Daltoniks, Billerica,
MA), an ion trap instrument equipped with an electrospray interface.
Column efﬂuent was monitored in positive mode of the MS. Major
MS parameters were: capillary exit, 3500 V; capillary offset, 500 V;
skim 1, 25.4 V; dry gas, 8 L/min; temperature, 300 ° C. Values are

RESULTS
Recovery tests. Results of recovery tests on SPE of cyani-
din-3-glucoside from urine was 90.0 /H110061.5% ( n /H110053); the
recovery of cyanidin-3-glucoside on SPE from plasma was 91.4

Elderberry study. No ACN peaks were detected in urine
samples collected before consumption of the elderberry extract
(Fig. 1A). In all samples collected from the four women after
they consumed the elderberry extract, a relatively large peak at
520 nm was observed in the chromatogram with a retention
time of 27 min (Fig. 1 B). Compared with the pro ﬁle of the
mixed standard of six ACN (Fig. 1 C), it appeared that this
peak contained cyanidin-3-glucoside. The enlarged chromato-
gram indicated that it contained two peaks ( Fig. 2A, Peaks 1
and 2). From the mass spectral data (Fig. 2B), we found one of
them, which was eluted a little bit earlier than the other, has
a molecular weight of 581.0 (mass-to-charge ratio, or m/z:
581.0). Its daughter fragment ion had an m/z of 287.2 from the
MS/MS data (Fig. 2 B). The other coeluting peak had an m/z
of 449.1, with a daughter fragment peak with an m/z of 287.2.
Comparing their elution times, spectra, and data from the
previous paper (17), we identiﬁed these two peaks as cyanidin-
3-sambubioside and cyanidin-3-glucoside. They are the major
ACN that account for /H1102290% of the total ACN in elderberry
(24) and cyanidin is the only ACN aglycone present in elder-
berry (25).
There were some additional small peaks with retention
times of 33 –36 min. Their spectra indicated that they were
also ACN. Their structures were further con ﬁrmed by MS

Anthocyanins (ACN) are part of a large and widespread
group of plant constituents known collectively as ﬂavonoids.
They are mainly distributed among ﬂowers, fruits and vegeta-
bles and are responsible for the bright colors that occur in
ﬂower petals, fruits and other plant organelles (1,2). ACN can
be used as natural colorants (3), but their use has been limited
because of their poor stability. As a potential major compo-
nent of our daily diet (4), more and more research has con-
centrated on their biological activities and possible health
beneﬁts in protecting against some chronic diseases, including
cancer, cardio- and cerebrovascular, atherosclerosis, and dia-
betes. Some of these biological activities and protective func-
tions may be attributable to their high antioxidant capacities
(5). Studies on antioxidant capacities of ACN revealed that
they could act in scavenging free radicals (6 – 8), metal che-
lation (4), protein binding (9), and other mechanisms.
To evaluate the health beneﬁts of ACN in humans, the
bioavailibility including absorption, distribution, metabolism,
and excretion must be known. It is also necessary to consider
the metabolites (such as ring-ﬁssion products produced by
microorganisms; conjugated and methylated derivatives, etc.)
instead of considering only the original form of ACN, as the
concentration of the original forms in human body is much
less than what was consumed (10). Metabolites may contrib-
ute, to some extent, to the positive health effects. However,
information about metabolism of ACN is quite limited.
As early as 1933, Horwitt (11) observed that the urine of
rabbits became highly pigmented after feeding ACN from
grapes. He concluded that small quantities of the grape ACN
or anthocyanidins were absorbed and passed through to the
circulation. ACN, which are present in plants as glycosides,
were long assumed not to be absorbed in the human body","A pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate the absorption and metabolism of red wine anthocyanins in human urine, revealing that anthocyanins are absorbed in glycated forms in elder women: a pharmacokinetic study.

The two major ACN in EBX, cyanidin-3-glucoside and cyanidin-3-sambubioside, as well as four\nmetabolites: 1) peonidin 3-glucoside, 2) peonidin 3-sambubioside, 3) peonidin monoglucuronide, and 4) cyanidin-\n3-glucoside monoglucuronide were identiﬁed in urine withi n4ho f consumption using HPLC-MS/MS with\ndiode-array detector detection and retention time. Total EBX ACN excretion was 554 /H1100690\n/H9262g (mean /H11006SD, n /H110054)\n(0.077% of intake/4 h, wt/wt). In 5 of 6 women fed BB, urine samples contained ACN, which were identiﬁed as the\noriginal forms based upon comparisons to the BB food sample, which contained 24 ACN, 22 of which were\nidentiﬁed by HPLC-MS/MS. Reasonable correlations between BB and urine proportions of the different ACN were\nobtained except for ACN arabinosides. Total urinary excretion during the ﬁrst 6 h was 23.2 /H1100610.9\n/H9262g (mean /H11006SD,\nn /H110055) (0.004% of intake/6 h, wt/wt). Plasma ACN levels were below detection limits using 2 mL plasma in women\nthat consumed BB. This study demonstrates for the ﬁrst time that in vivo methylation of cyanidin to peonidin and\nglucuronide conjugate formation occurs after people consume ACN and demonstrates the low absorption and\nexcretion of ACN compared with other ﬂavonoids. J. Nutr. 132: 1865–1871, 2002.\nKEY WORDS:\n● anthocyanin ● metabolite ● elderberry (Sambucus nigra)\n● blueberry (Vaccinium angustifolium)\nAnthocyanins (ACN) are part of a large and widespread\ngroup of plant constituents known collectively as ﬂavonoids.\nThey are mainly distributed among ﬂowers, fruits and vegeta-\nbles and are responsible for the bright colors that occur in\nﬂower petals, fruits and other plant organelles (1,2). ACN can\nbe used as natural colorants (3), but their use has been limited\nbecause of their poor stability. As a potential major compo-\nnent of our daily diet (4), more and more research has con-\ncentrated on their biological activities and possible health\nbeneﬁts in protecting against some chronic diseases, including\ncancer, cardio- and cerebrovascular, atherosclerosis, and dia-\nbetes. Some of these biological activities and protective func-\ntions may be attributable to their high antioxidant capacities\n(5). Studies on antioxidant capacities of ACN revealed that\nthey could act in scavenging free radicals (6 – 8), metal che-\nlation (4), protein binding (9), and other mechanisms.\nTo evaluate the health beneﬁts of ACN in humans, the\nbioavailibility including absorption, distribution, metabolism,\nand excretion must be known. It is also necessary to consider\nthe metabolites (such as ring-ﬁssion products produced by\nmicroorganisms; conjugated and methylated derivatives, etc.)\ninstead of considering only the original form of ACN, as the\nconcentration of the original forms in human body is much\nless than what was consumed (10). Metabolites may contrib-\nute, to some extent, to the positive health effects. However,\ninformation about metabolism of ACN is quite limited.\nAs early as 1933, Horwitt (11) observed that the urine of\nrabbits became highly pigmented after feeding ACN from\ngrapes. He concluded that small quantities of the grape ACN\nor anthocyanidins were absorbed and passed through to the\ncirculation. ACN, which are present in plants as glycosides,\nwere long assumed not to be absorbed in the human body']","during the ﬁrst 6 h being only 0.004% of the quantity con-
sumed.

WU ET AL.1870","Lipid peroxidation is a process where unsaturated fatty acids are oxidized, leading to the formation of free radicals that can damage cellular structures. Anthocyanins, found in fruits and vegetables, have been shown to inhibit lipid peroxidation by scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as peroxyl and hydroxyl radicals. This property makes them effective antioxidants and beneficial for maintaining cellular health.",0.9999999999666667,
