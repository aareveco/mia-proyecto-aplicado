"What does the DISCUSSION section say about ACN absorption, metabolism, and why nobody found glucuronide or sulfate conjugated forms before?","['lower detection limit under our current conditions would be\n0.005 mg/L (based on cyanidin-3-glucoside).\nDISCUSSION\nACN have been considered to not be absorbed in the\nhuman body, unless they were ﬁrst hydrolyzed to the aglycone\nin the gastrointestinal tract. The poor lipophilic properties of\nACN have led to the conviction that they are underabsorbed.\nHorwitt (11) was perhaps the ﬁrst to observe the ACN pig-\nments in the urine of rabbits. Recently, however, several\ninvestigators have concluded that ACN can be absorbed in\nboth human and animal bodies as intact forms (12 –23). Some\ninvestigators have shown that quercetin glucosides may inter-\nact with the intestinal glucose transporter and be absorbed in\nthat manner (28 –30). Whether ACN could be absorbed by a\nsimilar mechanism remains unknown. Mu ¨ lleder et al. (22)\ncompared the urinary excretion when elderberry ACN were\nconsumed with and without simultaneous ingestion of sugar.\nThe total excretion of ACN with sugar was lower than that\nwithout sugar, indicating that sugar carriers might play a role\nin ﬂavonoid absorption. The presence of the sambubioside\nform gives strong credence to this as it is unlikely that the\nsambubioside form could be reformed from the aglycone after\nits absorption.\nPrevious studies have also indicated that methylation is an\nestablished pathway in the metabolism of ﬂavonoids (26). For\nseveral ﬂavonoids with 3 /H11032,4 /H11032-dihydroxylation of ring B, con-\njugates of their 3 /H11032-O-methyl ethers were excreted (31 –32).\nThis transformation occurred in the liver and was catalyzed by\ncatechol-O-methyl transferase (14,33). Cyanidin is an antho-\ncyanidin with a 3 /H11032,4 /H11032-dihydroxylation pattern of ring B. We\ndetected peonidin 3-glucoside and peonidin 3-sambubioside in\nthe urine from humans. Miyazawa et al. (15) found a methyl-\nated form of an ACN in liver of rats and the concentration of\nthe methylated form was much higher than the original form\nin the liver, but they did not detect it in plasma and urine.\nThey (15) assumed that these methylated compounds were\nexcreted from the liver into bile directly. However, we de-\ntected the methylated form of ACN in the urine of humans.\nThus, they must appear in the blood and be excreted by the\nkidney.\nConjugations with glucuronic acid or with sulfate are con-\nsidered the major detoxication pathways of many drugs and\nxenobiotic compounds. They are also the common ﬁnal steps\nin the metabolic pathway of ﬂavonoids in mammalian systems\n(26,34). These modiﬁcations could start in the small intestine,\nliver, or kidney (35 –36). UDP-glucuronosyl transferase and\nsulfotransferase in the liver would likely be responsible for this\nconjugation (26,37). So far, many different subclasses of ﬂa-\nvonoids have been found to be absorbed and excreted as\nglucuronide forms in both humans and experimental animals\n(26,35,37,38). But for ACN, no glucuronide or sulfate conju-\ngated forms have been found in urine or plasma of either\nhumans or experimental animals. This observation is com-\npletely different from other ﬂavonoids, such as catechin and\nepicatechin, or iso ﬂavones such as genistein and daidzein,\nwhose basic structures are similar to ACN. Miyazawa et al.\n(15) assumed that the ﬂavylium cation structure of ACN may\nimpart resistance to such enzymatic conversion into conju-\ngates.\nIn our studies we detected the glucuronide conjugate forms\nfor the ﬁrst time. These results indicate that ACN might share\nsome of the same metabolic pathways with other ﬂavonoid\ncompounds. Perhaps, others did not detect them because of\nthe low concentrations of these metabolites. We detected and\ntentatively identi ﬁed them using diode –array detector and\nMS. We were unsuccessful in hydrolyzing the conjugate with\nthe enzyme\n/H9252-glucuronidase (1 U/L for 30 min). Hydrolysis of\nthe conjugated forms of ACN presents particular challenges in\nthat ACN are unstable at neutral pH. The ACN disappeared\ncompletely when we incubated the plasma samples for 3 h.']","The DISCUSSION section states that ACN were considered not to be absorbed in the human body unless hydrolyzed, due to poor lipophilic properties. However, recent investigators have concluded ACN can be absorbed as intact forms. It mentions quercetin glucosides interacting with the intestinal glucose transporter and the possibility of a similar mechanism for ACN. The section also discusses methylation as an established pathway in flavonoid metabolism, noting the detection of peonidin 3-glucoside and peonidin 3-sambubioside in human urine. Furthermore, it explains that conjugations with glucuronic acid or sulfate are major detoxication pathways for many drugs, xenobiotic compounds, and flavonoids, but previously, no glucuronide or sulfate conjugated forms of ACN had been found in urine or plasma. The text suggests that the flavylium cation structure of ACN may impart resistance to enzymatic conversion into conjugates. The study detected glucuronide conjugate forms for the first time, indicating ACN might share some metabolic pathways with other flavonoid compounds, and suggests that others may not have detected them due to low concentrations. The study was unsuccessful in hydrolyzing the conjugate with the enzyme /H9252-glucuronidase (1 U/L for 30 min) because ACN are unstable at neutral pH.",Analista Junior,POOR_GRAMMAR,LONG,single_hop_specific_query_synthesizer

It reduces astringency and alters its\ncomposition, particularly in the phenolic compound content, which is related to cocoa health benefits. This study\naimed to investigate the impact of alkalization on the composition of seven commercial cocoa powders. A liquid\nchromatography-based metabolomic approach was employed to assess the metabolic differences between\nalkalized and non-alkalized cocoa powders. Supervised orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis\n(OPLS-DA) was used to identify the most discriminating variables between groups. A feature-based molecular\nnetwork (FBMN) was used to explore the chemical space. Three hundred forty-seven metabolites were obtained\nas the most discriminant, among which 60 were tentatively annotated. Phenolic compounds, lysophosphatidy-\nlethanolamines, amino acids, and their derivatives were significantly reduced in alkalized cocoas. In contrast,\nfatty acids and their derivatives significantly increased with alkalization. Despite the variability among com-\nmercial cocoas, chemometrics allowed the elucidation of alterations induced specifically by alkalization in their\ncomposition.\n1. Introduction\nCocoa is a widely distributed and globally recognized product. Its\ncolor, flavor, functional compounds, and established health benefits\ncollectively contribute to its high regard as a favored food among con-\nsumers and industries. Cocoa beans are extracted and fermented from\nthe harvested cocoa pods of Theobroma cacao to obtain nibs. The nibs,\nwhich are unshelled and fermented cocoa seeds, represent the final\nproduct of the primary cocoa production process. They are ground to\nobtain a paste called “ cocoa liquor ” . Cocoa liquor is pressed and divided\ninto a solid part, known as “ cocoa cake ” and an oily part, “ cocoa butter ” .\nThe cake is processed into “ cocoa powder ” . Cocoa powder is recognized\nfor its light color, low solubility, and acidic, astringent, and bitter taste.\nAlkalization is a process used to enhance cocoa powder solubility;\nmoreover it has the capacity to modify color and flavor. Incorporating\nan alkalization process darkens the color, reduces adverse sensory at-\ntributes, and enhances cocoa solubility ( Valverde García, P ´erez Esteve,\n& Barat Baviera, 2020 ).

While\nnumerous studies have employed LC-MS/MS to analyze the chemical\ncomponents in chocolate ( de Dias et al., 2023 ) and cocoa beans ( Bacca-\nVillota, Acu ˜na-García, Sierra-Guevara, Cano, & Hidalgo, 2023 ), only a\nfew articles have documented the comprehensive or the discovery of\nnew compounds resulting from the alkalization process ( Gre ˜no, Herrero,\nCifuentes, Marina, & Castro-Puyana, 2022 ). Cocoa powders typically\nconsist of a mixture of numerous compounds, resulting in complex mass\nspectrometry data after LC-MS/MS analysis, which difficult the inter-\npretation. The use of molecular networking (MN) can aid in data\ninterpretation. MN is a method for visualizing tandem MS/MS data that\ncalculates the similarity degree of the MS/MS spectra and organizes\nthem into a network, connecting compounds with similar structural el-\nements through edges ( Tong et al., 2021 ). This technique is valuable for\nanalyzing complex chemical compositions, identifying quality, trace-\nability, and safety biomarkers, and detecting contaminants and adul-\nterants in foods ( Li et al., 2023 ). It has become essential for examining\nthe structures of compounds found in plant-based foods, enabling the\nidentification of multiple unannotated compounds within a single group\n( Tong et al., 2021 ).\nThus, this study aimed to assess the metabolic differences between\nalkalized and non-alkalized (natural) cocoa powders using a non-\ntargeted high-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-\nflight mass spectrometry (HPLC-QTOF-MS)-based metabolomic\napproach.

"What alkalization do to cocoa, like, in terms of color and stuff?","[""study conducted with cocoa beverages, in which alkalized samples received the highest liking scores in terms of color ( Palma-Morales, Rune, Castilla-Ortega, Giacalone, & Rodríguez-P ´erez, 2024 ). During alkalization, cocoa is infused with an alkaline solution (usually NaOH and K 2 CO 3 in concentrations from 1 to 6%) and it is exposed to precise temperatures (ranging from 60 to 130 ◦ C) and pressures (varying from 0.10 to 1.22 MPa) for periods lasting from 5 to 180 min ( Valverde García et al., 2020 ). Color changes result from various chemical reactions enhanced by alkaline conditions, oxygen, temperature, and pressure. These include the formation of Maillard reaction products, oxidation and polymerization of polyphenols, their interactions with other mole- cules, and the enhanced activity of polyphenol oxidase under basic conditions. Additionally, some authors have reported that alkaline so- lutions break ester links and hydrolyze cell walls. These effects, com- bined with high temperatures and pressures, lead to increased solubility through the destabilization and destruction of various complexes and cell structures ( Valverde García et al., 2020 ). This process has also previously described to affect cocoa's composition. ( Goya, Kongor, & de Pascual-Teresa, 2022 ). Cocoa contains three primary categories of polyphenols, including flavanols such as catechin, epicatechin, and gallocatechin; anthocyanins (leucoanthocyanins and cyanidins); and proanthocyanidins (dimers, trimers, and other polymers of flavan-3-ols). To a lesser extent, cocoa also contains flavones, such as apigenin, luteolin, and kaempferol, alongside phenolic acids, such as caffeic and chlorogenic acids. These compounds are associated with a range of advantages for the cardiovascular system, including lowering insulin resistance and anti-inflammatory properties, but also with pos- itive impacts on gut microbiota, and the improvement of cognitive function ( Palma-Morales, Melgar-Locatelli, Castilla-Ortega, & Rodrí- guez-P""]","During alkalization, cocoa is infused with an alkaline solution and exposed to precise temperatures and pressures for specific periods. Color changes result from chemical reactions enhanced by alkaline conditions, oxygen, temperature, and pressure, including the formation of Maillard reaction products, oxidation and polymerization of polyphenols, their interactions with other molecules, and the enhanced activity of polyphenol oxidase under basic conditions. Some authors have reported that alkaline solutions break ester links and hydrolyze cell walls, leading to increased solubility through the destabilization and destruction of various complexes and cell structures.",Químico Experto,POOR_GRAMMAR,MEDIUM,single_hop_specific_query_synthesizer

"Where did the funding for the study on the effects of alkalization on commercial cocoa powders come from, including specific grant numbers and funding organizations?","['in combination with chemometrics and computational metabolomics\ntools, allowing for a thorough investigation of the metabolite profile of\nfoods. By employing this approach, we can gain a comprehensive un-\nderstanding of how various treatments, such as alkalization, impact the\nquality and safety of foods, as well as assess the preservation, trans-\nformation, or reduction of bioactive compounds that may have a posi-\ntive effect on consumer health. Moreover, exploring the impact of\nalkalization on the metabolic profile of cocoa would enable us to opti-\nmize production processes and enhance the quality of the final product,\nthereby improving its overall quality, safety, and nutritional value.\nOther studies have investigated the effect of alkalization on the\ncomposition of cocoa by controlling the parameters of this process\n( Gre ˜no et al., 2022 ; Rodríguez et al., 2009 ), however, in the present\nwork, the focus was on elucidating the effects of alkalization on different\ncommercial cocoa powders, for which the specific parameters used in\nthe process are unknown. This strengthens the results obtained, making\nthem more applicable to consumers, as they reflect the commercial re-\nality that can be found in the market. Despite the variability in the\ntreatments applied and other factors, such as origin, certain trends in the\ncomposition of cocoa associated with the alkalization process were\nobserved. Further research is needed to elucidate how other factors,\nsuch as the origin of cocoa, can affect its composition.\n4. Conclusion\nIn summary, this study investigated how alkalization affects the\ncompositions of different commercial cocoa powders. It is worth high-\nlighting the advantage of using a non-targeted method, as it allows for a\nbroad coverage of metabolites, enabling the identification of several\nsecondary metabolites, such as polyphenols, alkaloids terpenoids or\neven fungal-related metabolites, lipids and amino acids. To the best of\nour knowledge, 20 metabolites have were tentatively characterized for\nthe first time in cocoa. Despite the variability between commercial co-\ncoas, changes in various metabolites have been identified between\nnatural and alkalized cocoas, elucidating alterations induced by the\nalkalization process. Specifically, phenolic compounds, which are\nessential contributors to cocoa health properties, showed significant\nreductions in alkalized cocoas, consistent with previous studies. Lipid\nderivatives, peptides, and amino acids also exhibit fluctuations,\nreflecting the interaction between the alkalization process and cocoa\ncomposition. Generally, fatty acids and derivatives tended to increase\nwith alkalization, whereas lysophosphatidylethanolamines, amino\nacids, and derivatives tended to decrease. Lastly, we report for the first\ntime the reduction of salsolinol, a potential neurotoxin, after alkaliza-\ntion. Furthermore, this study highlighted the utility of advanced\nanalytical techniques, multivariate statistical analysis and FBMN, to\nanalyze, identify and annotate food compounds, thus revealing the\ncomplex metabolic signature of cocoa. Additionally, these techniques\ncould be useful for identifyng biomarkers related to the alkalization\nprocess, which could be employed in cocoa authentication. Although\nFBMN is an emerging tool in foodomics, it can provide valuable insights\ninto the chemical composition of food.\nFunding\nThis study was funded by Grant PID2020-114374RB-I00 funded by\nMCIN/AEI/10.13039/501100011033 (to C.R.-P. and E.C.-O.) and Junta\nde Andalucía-Consejería de Universidad, Investigaci ´on e Innova-\nci ´on — Project P21_00777.\nCRediT authorship contribution statement\nMarta Palma-Morales: Writing – review & editing, Writing – orig-\ninal draft, Visualization, Methodology, Investigation, Formal analysis,\nData curation, Conceptualization.

Hence, the present study utilised LC-MS analysis previously established for banana samples including method optimisation']","Tannins and lignin are biopolymers of phenylpropanoid derived compounds (further referred to as phenylpropanoids) and part of the plant defence mechanism against biotic and abiotic stresses. Additionally, phenylpropanoids act as antioxidants with many health promoting properties in the human diet and are naturally converted to aroma volatiles in the banana tissue.",Químico Experto,WEB_SEARCH_LIKE,SHORT,single_hop_specific_query_synthesizer

What influence of peel on banana fruit quality?,"['content of cell wall per dry weight and the lowest content of lignin. \nMetabolite identification highlighted that the hexosides of ferulic and \nsinapic acid were the dominant phenylpropanoids. Previous literature \nindicated that the glycosylation is a storage response and the phenyl -\npropanoids cannot be accessed by enzymes for monolignol biosynthesis, \nleading to the contradictory data of high precursor and low lignin con -\ntent ( Kytidou et al., 2020; Perez-Fons et al., 2019; Tsamo et al., 2015 ). \nFurthermore, the levels of procyanidins B were ~ 14-fold higher in \nplantains compared to the other two genome groups. This suggests that a \nlarge portion of the cell wall in plantains is composed of condensed \ntannins, which is reflected in the high levels of procyanidins. Plantains \nwere the only genome group containing a B genome in the present study, \nwhich suggests that the B genome contains regulatory genes for \ncondensed tannin biosynthesis ( Carreel et al., 2002; Perrier, 2009 ). \nTannins have a range of biological activities related to fruit quality \nincluding antimicrobial, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory, which \nrepresent important traits for farmer and consumer preference and can \nbe elucidated through a combination of system biology techniques and \nphenotyping. \n4.4.

Previous studies \nalso reported an increase of anti-nutritional components (e.g. tannins) in \nthe fruit tissue under abiotic stress and pesticide treatment ( Pandey \net al., 2016 ). Tannins and other phenolics are naturally enriched in the \npulp during ripening and metabolised through polymerisation to reduce \nthe astringent mouthfeel caused by these metabolites. During the \nripening process, ethylene is mainly produced in the pulp and diffused to \nthe peel ( John & Marchal, 1995 ). These observations highlight the \nprevalent interaction between pulp and peel tissue. The peel presents a \nprotective layer for the pulp and contains a wide range of phenyl -\npropanoids involved in constitutive and induced defence mechanisms, e. \ng. cell wall strengthening and signalling ( Pandey et al., 2016 ). Phenyl -\npropanoids are traditionally hydrophilic compounds referring a bitter \nand/or astringent taste, which suggests the peel as a source of metabo -\nlites, potentially transported to the pulp, with an undesired effect on the \ntaste aspect of fruit quality.

After data \nprocessing, non-supervised and supervised methods were applied to carry out the statistical data analysis. Thus, \nthe most significant metabolites that allow establishing differences among the cocoa powder samples submitted \nto the alkalization processes were pointed out. Thus, 43 and 30 metabolites in positive and negative ionization \nmodes, respectively, demonstrated to be relevant. Among them, 9 compounds were unequivocally identified and \n22 tentatively identified. Most of them were amino acids, alkaloids, organic acids or polyphenols, among others.   \n1. Introduction \nCocoa is a highly valued product, consumed all over the world not \nonly for its pleasant flavor and aroma but also for the nutritional and \nhealth benefits that it presents. These properties make cocoa a suitable \ningredient in the food industry and personal care products. Despite the \nsweet flavor of chocolate (the most known cocoa-based product) cocoa \nis characterized by presenting acidity, astringency, and bitterness \nproperties. These non-desirable properties could be reduced using an \nalkalization (or dutching) process ( Sioriki et al., 2021 ; Valverde et al., \n2020 ) which is based on the combination of an alkali solution (usually \nNaOH and K\n2\nCO\n3 \nin concentration from 1 to 6%) with cocoa. A partic -\nular temperature, (from 60 to 130 \n◦\nC), and pressure (from 0.10 to 1.22 \nMPa) are applied during a period between 5 and 180 min ( Valve -\nrde-García et al., 2020 ). In general, the final product is classified ac -\ncording to its pH value, which may range from pH 5.0 to pH 8.0. In this \nway, the product is labeled as dark natural if the pH is between 5.0 and \n6.0, light alkalized cocoa when the pH is from 6.0 to 7.2, medium \nalkalized cocoa when the pH range is between 7.2 and 7.6, and strongly \nalkalized cocoa when the product has a pH value higher than 7.6 ( Miller \net al., 2008 ). The use of the different alkalized cocoa powders depends \non the final application of the product: natural and light alkalized cocoa \npowders are employed to produce chocolate, ice creams, and cocoa \nbeverages whereas medium and strong alkalized cocoa powders are \nmainly used to prepare ice creams and bakery products such as cookies \nor cakes ( Valverde-García et al., 2020 ). \nDepending on the alkali solution, temperature, pressure, and time']","1. Introduction says cocoa is like, a product that people like all over the world. They like it cause it tastes good and smells good, but also cause it's good for you. So, like, they use it in food and stuff. But cocoa, it's got some problems, like it's bitter and stuff. So they do this thing called alkalization to make it not so bad. They use stuff like NaOH and K2CO3 and heat it up and put pressure on it. Then, depending on how much they do it, it gets a pH value. If the pH is between 5.0 and 6.0, it's dark natural. If it's from 6.0 to 7.2, it's light alkalized. If it's between 7.2 and 7.6, it's medium alkalized. And if it's higher than 7.6, it's strongly alkalized.

The MS/MS spectrum of this \ncompound showed an intense fragment ion at m/z 132 corresponding to \nthe double decarboxylation and following N -CO α -cleavage which cor -\nresponds to aspartate. In addition, the ion at m/z 161 was useful to \nconfirm the hydroxycinnamoyl moiety ( Lavorgna et al., 2021 ) Com -\npound 17 ([M-H]\n- \n= 305 m/z ) was tentatively assigned to hydrox -\nyjasmonic acid sulfate which had an intense MS/MS fragment at m/z \n225 ( Patras et al., 2014 ). This compound has been previously reported in \nstudies related to the effect of the fermentation process in cocoa beans \nstudied ( Patras et al., 2014 ; D ’ Souza et al., 2017 ). The level of this \ncompound did not change significantly during the alkalization process. \nCompounds 21 and 22 displayed the same [M-H]- ion at m/z 393. \nThe main fragment at m/z 249 observed in their MS/MS spectra allow \nthe identification of these compounds as hexenyl primeveroside isomers, \naccording to the literature ( C ´adiz-Gurrea et al., 2010 , 2020 ).

Its level was increased from CN to \nCL and CM and decreased with strong alkalization (although its level \ncontinues to be higher than in CN). \nFrom the results obtained, it is demonstrated that the metabolomic \nassessment of cocoa power during the alkalization process by using the \ndeveloped analytical methodology allows proposing a set of compounds \nof different nature as potential markers of the alkalization process. \nHowever, to achieve a more detailed information about the potential of \nthese markers, it would be necessary to obtain a more comprehensive \nanalysis so that the metabolomics strategy should be employed to \nanalyze a larger number of samples. \n4.

Subsequently, the same fragmentation pattern of caffeine was observed (ion fragments at m/z 138 and 110)]. Although other authors have reported a decrease in the level of these compounds when the alkalization degree increases ( Li et al., 2012 ), the trend observed in this work corresponds to a slight increase of theobromine and caffeine levels at the highest alkalization degree in comparison with that obtained for natural cocoa. Sioriki et al. reported that alkalization did not produce any significant change in the concentration of theo - bromine in the cocoa powder which is in agreement with our results ( Sioriki et al., 2021 , 2022 ).
