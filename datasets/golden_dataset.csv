What is the main focus of this study on anthocyanins (ACN) and blueberries?,"['Human Nutrition and Metabolism\nAbsorption and Metabolism of Anthocyanins in Elderly Women after\nConsumption of Elderberry or Blueberry\nXianli Wu,* Guohua Cao † and Ronald L. Prior 1,3\n*U.S. Department of Agriculture, Agriculture Research Service, Arkansas Children’s Nutrition Center,\nLittle Rock, AR 72202 and †U.S. Department of Agriculture Human Nutrition Research Center\non Aging at Tufts, Boston 02111\nABSTRACT The absorption and metabolism of anthocyanins (ACN) in humans was studied in four elderly women\ngiven 12 g elderberry extract (EBX) (720 mg total ACN), and six elderly women given 189 g lowbush blueberry (BB)\n(690 mg total ACN). The two major ACN in EBX, cyanidin-3-glucoside and cyanidin-3-sambubioside, as well as four\nmetabolites: 1) peonidin 3-glucoside, 2) peonidin 3-sambubioside, 3) peonidin monoglucuronide, and 4) cyanidin-\n3-glucoside monoglucuronide were identiﬁed in urine withi n4ho f consumption using HPLC-MS/MS with\ndiode-array detector detection and retention time. Total EBX ACN excretion was 554 /H1100690\n/H9262g (mean /H11006SD, n /H110054)\n(0.077% of intake/4 h, wt/wt). In 5 of 6 women fed BB, urine samples contained ACN, which were identiﬁed as the\noriginal forms based upon comparisons to the BB food sample, which contained 24 ACN, 22 of which were\nidentiﬁed by HPLC-MS/MS. Reasonable correlations between BB and urine proportions of the different ACN were\nobtained except for ACN arabinosides. Total urinary excretion during the ﬁrst 6 h was 23.2 /H1100610.9\n/H9262g (mean /H11006SD,\nn /H110055) (0.004% of intake/6 h, wt/wt). Plasma ACN levels were below detection limits using 2 mL plasma in women\nthat consumed BB. This study demonstrates for the ﬁrst time that in vivo methylation of cyanidin to peonidin and\nglucuronide conjugate formation occurs after people consume ACN and demonstrates the low absorption and\nexcretion of ACN compared with other ﬂavonoids.

Nutr. 132: 1865–1871, 2002.\nKEY WORDS:\n● anthocyanin ● metabolite ● elderberry (Sambucus nigra)\n● blueberry (Vaccinium angustifolium)\nAnthocyanins (ACN) are part of a large and widespread\ngroup of plant constituents known collectively as ﬂavonoids.\nThey are mainly distributed among ﬂowers, fruits and vegeta-\nbles and are responsible for the bright colors that occur in\nﬂower petals, fruits and other plant organelles (1,2). ACN can\nbe used as natural colorants (3), but their use has been limited\nbecause of their poor stability. As a potential major compo-\nnent of our daily diet (4), more and more research has con-\ncentrated on their biological activities and possible health\nbeneﬁts in protecting against some chronic diseases, including\ncancer, cardio- and cerebrovascular, atherosclerosis, and dia-\nbetes. Some of these biological activities and protective func-\ntions may be attributable to their high antioxidant capacities\n(5). Studies on antioxidant capacities of ACN revealed that\nthey could act in scavenging free radicals (6 – 8), metal che-\nlation (4), protein binding (9), and other mechanisms.\nTo evaluate the health beneﬁts of ACN in humans, the\nbioavailibility including absorption, distribution, metabolism,\nand excretion must be known. It is also necessary to consider\nthe metabolites (such as ring-ﬁssion products produced by\nmicroorganisms; conjugated and methylated derivatives, etc.)\ninstead of considering only the original form of ACN, as the\nconcentration of the original forms in human body is much\nless than what was consumed (10). Metabolites may contrib-\nute, to some extent, to the positive health effects. However,\ninformation about metabolism of ACN is quite limited.\nAs early as 1933, Horwitt (11) observed that the urine of\nrabbits became highly pigmented after feeding ACN from\ngrapes. He concluded that small quantities of the grape ACN\nor anthocyanidins were absorbed and passed through to the\ncirculation. ACN, which are present in plants as glycosides,\nwere long assumed not to be absorbed in the human body']","The study focuses on the absorption, metabolism, and excretion of anthocyanins (ACN) in elderly women after consuming either 12 g elderberry extract (EBX) or 189 g lowbush blueberry (BB). It aims to evaluate the bioavailability including absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of ACN.",Analista Junior,PERFECT_GRAMMAR,LONG,single_hop_specific_query_synthesizer
